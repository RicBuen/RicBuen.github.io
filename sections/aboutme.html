                                My name is Ricky Buenafe, and I currently reside in Queens NYC, living here my whole life.
                                Already having a strong foundation and experience with computers and a strong interest in modern technology for a long time now.
                                I have started following the path of becoming a software developer. Having become proficient in several languages,
                                as well as in several databases and frameworks for web and desktop applications development.
                                I stared my own projects over these past to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end software development.
                              </p>

                              <p id = "para2">
                                I have decided to put my knowledge and skills gained from doing these projects, and help clients build web and even desktop related applications.
                                I don't build a specific type of website or desktop application. I build whatever idea goes through my mind, or an idea that someone comes up with and
                                I help them build whatever they need that satisfies their needs. I like to keep design interface simple and easy for users to use and navigate through,
                                nothing fancy or "show offy", but I can design whatever design specification a client has in mind. I am especially proficient in safely working and managing
                                important and sensitive user data, making sure they are safely saved in databases and making sure no hacker will be able to access such information.
